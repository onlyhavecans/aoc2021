# My Advent of Code 2021 Solutions in Rust

Some of us at [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com) are doing the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) together.

I chose to implement my solutions in Rust as I haven't used the language since 2018 and felt... RUSTY

## Running

```shell
cargo run --bin <dayXX>
```

Here are some of the sites I'm learning Rust from:
